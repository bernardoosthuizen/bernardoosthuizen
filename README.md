### Hi  ðŸ‘‹

Nice to meet you! I'm Bernie, a Software Engineer based in Hong Kong exploring all things data engineering and cloud.

I am currently working on Fly Privi, the world's first empty-leg flight aggregator. This project has really challenged me as an engineer and exposed me to new frameworks, architectures and gotchas. A whole lot of gotchas! This project has sparked a fascination for data pipelines and cloud architecture, so much so that I plan on pursuing these fields after completing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.

I have recently pivoted from a successful career in aviation, where I gained valuable transferable skills in leadership, communication, teamwork and problem-solving. I have a strong track record of fast learning and adapting in high-stress, operationally critical environments.

I would love to hear from you.
