### Hi  ðŸ‘‹

Nice to meet you! I'm Bernie, a Pilot and Software Engineer based in Hong Kong. When I'm not flying, I explore the intersection of aviation and technology to help organisations serve their customers better by building elegant, data-driven, cloud-based solutions.

I am currently working on Fly Privi, the world's first empty-leg flight aggregator. This project has sparked a fascination for data pipelines and cloud architecture, so much so that I plan on pursuing these fields after completing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.

If you have an idea that you want to bring to life, I would love to hear from you.
